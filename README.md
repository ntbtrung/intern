This is my small internship project for undergraduate level.
Topic: Eye Region Detection and Gaze Prediction

The [Eye Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kayvanshah/eye-dataset) is used and [the model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hossamfakher/eyes-acc-100-loss-0-01)'s parameters are adjusted to fit with the program. Then, `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` with `Haarcascade` for the eye region detection.

[Visualkeras](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/) for visualizing model, which is a mini-great experience to discover.

The [Human Faces Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces) is used to test the model performance on untrained data
